# DataMining_MachineLearningApplications

Applying five different Machine Learning Classification Techniques in three different datasets and reporting the comparative study between the models' predictions and accuracy. All the codes are written in R programming language. This work looked into two major classes of ML models, (a) Classification Model and (b) Regression model. In this work, I have explored four different types of Classification Models, (a) Decision Tree, (b) Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), (c) Random Forest and (d) Naïve-Bayes Model; and one type of Regression model, particularly Multiple Linear Regression Model. For each analysis, the model is trained sample data, which is a random patch of the whole dataset and the test set is used for measuring model accuracy. 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS IN DETAIL :

* <b>Fraudulent Transactions Identification:</b>
Analysing 10,48,575 credit card transactions history to identify fraudulent and non‐fraudulent transactions by training two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Finally, compare the models’ performances on the test data using ROC Curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix etc.

<b>NOTE:</b> Data can be found on [DATA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GRU_7RRZCGkcf9YhtWyHb5QPq7nte2H7/view?usp=share_link)

* <b>Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction: </b>
Analysing 1,03,904 passenger survey data of a USA airline to predict the overall passengers’ satisfaction level based on the different survey scores on the various services offered using two machine learning techniques, Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier. Finally, compare the models’ performances on the test data using ROC Curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix etc. and opt for the best-performed model on the test data with logical argument.

* <b>Diamond Price Prediction: </b> 
Analysing 53,940 different diamond prices based on 11 different physical properties and developing a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict the diamond prices. All the necessary assumptions have been verified before modelling and the model performance has been estimated using MSE and RMSE.
